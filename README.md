# stacks_towers_of_hanoi_project
This is my solution to the "Towers of Hanoi" stacks project assignment on Code Academy.
The stack.py and node.py files were used as developed by CodeAcademy, i.e. they were not written by me. I uploaded them for the code in the towers_of_hanoi_stack_project.py to make sense.
